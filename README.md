# About Me.

## My Interests
 - I am a college student who loves playing sports. I study cybersecurity in school, but I like to get away from my desk sometimes. I love playing volleyball and soccer. They are by far my favorite sports. I also like to rock climb and go to the gym when I get the chance. I'm always interested in meeting new people and make a point to be with friends regularly.
## My goals
 - I would like to learn as much as possible in the field of cybersecurity as I can. I have not decided exactly what path to take but digital forensics has my attention. I want to learn and grow as much as possible and want to make the most of my time.
