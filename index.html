<h1>My name is Tomas Cruz</h1>
<div>
<p>I am a student at Wake Tech who wants to learn about cybersecurity. I am very interested in digital forensics and want to get my start in IT work. For fun I like to go to the gym and play sports, mainly soccer and volleyball. I have a motorcycle as well that I love to ride. I hope to graduate next year and look for a job in forensics.</p>
